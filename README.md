Official Android training tutorials from the Android Developer documentation at developer.android.com

I am attempting to make several small commits based on the official documentation from Google about how to develop apps using Android Studio. There are some minor discrepancies between the code snippets that Google provides and the defaults that are given in Android Studio 1.0.1 (at the time of this writing). I will try my damndest to ensure that the code works and that it conforms to the best practices.
Let's do this!
